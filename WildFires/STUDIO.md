# Watson Studio Set up and Configuration in IBM Cloud

## Lab Objectives

In this lab you will set up Watson Studio with a new Project.  You will learn:

- Watson Studio
- How to set up a new Watson Studio Project

### Introduction

Watson Studio accelerates the machine and deep learning workflows required to infuse AI into your business to drive innovation. It provides a suite of tools for data scientists, application developers and subject matter experts, allowing them to collaboratively connect to data, wrangle that data and use it to build, train and deploy models at scale. Successful AI projects require a combination of algorithms + data + team, and a very powerful compute infrastructure.
